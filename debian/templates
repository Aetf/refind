_Description: Automatically install rEFInd to the ESP?
 It is necessary to install rEFInd to the EFI System Partition (ESP) for
 it to control the boot process.
 .
 Not installing the new rEFInd binary on the ESP may leave the system in an
 unbootable state. Alternatives to automatically installing rEFInd include
 running /usr/sbin/refind-install by hand or installing the rEFInd binaries
 manually by copying them from subdirectories of /usr/share/refind-{version}.
