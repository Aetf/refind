Requirements
============

To compile rEFInd, you'll need the following:

* A Linux installation. Note that this installation does NOT need to be
  EFI-based. It can use IA32 (aka x86, i386, or other things), X64 (aka
  x86-64, AMD64, or EM64T), or AA64 (aka AARCH64 or ARM64), but unless you
  use a cross-compiler, it must use the same CPU type and bit depth as your
  EFI implementation. (Normally that means 64-bit X64.) If you don't
  normally run Linux, you can run it in a VirtualBox or similar virtual
  machine. (I describe some unsupported non-Linux build options later.)

* A standard set of Linux development tools, based on GCC. (I've tried
  using Clang 3.4 under Ubuntu, with partial success. The main rEFInd
  binary, gptsync, and some drivers compile successfully; but only gptsync
  runs normally. The drivers I've tried and the main rEFInd binary crash.)

* One of the following:

  * The TianoCore EDK2/UDK package (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2). This
    toolkit is available in an unstable development version (EDK2) or in
    "frozen" forms (UDK2010, UDK2014, and so on); however, the term "EDK2"
    is often used in reference to the TianoCore toolkit generally. To
    simplify matters, I officially support only one UDK version at any given
    moment. Currently (rEFInd 0.10.9), rEFInd compiles with UDK2014; but a
    UDK2017 release is expected soon, so I've been making changes in an
    effort to make rEFInd compatible with this soon-to-be-released version.
    See below for TianoCore setup instructions.

  * The GNU-EFI package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-efi/). You can
    install this from a package called "gnu-efi"; however, rEFInd relies on
    features that were added sometime between version 3.0s and 3.0u, so I
    recommend using 3.0u or later. The latest versions of GNU-EFI have
    abandoned the trailing letter and switched to a more traditional
    additional number, as in 3.0.2. You should check your GNU-EFI version
    number; you may need to download the latest source code, compile it, and
    install it locally. The Makefiles assume a GNU-EFI package installed via
    a package manager. If you install from source code, you may need to
    adjust those Makefiles' paths.

Of the two toolkits, I prefer to use TianoCore because it produces binaries
that are about 5-30KiB smaller than those made by GNU-EFI, and I can easily
build 32-bit binaries on my 64-bit Linux installations. Also, I've had
problems on a 32-bit Mac Mini with the drivers produced by GNU-EFI hanging
the system. (I haven't encountered this problem on UEFI-based PCs.) That
said, the TianoCore EDK2 package is much harder to install, so you may
prefer to use GNU-EFI unless you have a specific need for the TianoCore
toolkit. Automated build tools like the OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS) and
the Ubuntu Personal Package Archive (PPA) mechanism don't yet support
TianoCore.


Preparing Your Development Kit
==============================

If you're using Linux, GNU-EFI is the easiest way to compile rEFInd. I
don't describe GNU-EFI's setup here because it's likely to be fairly easy.
If your distribution provides a recent enough version, you should be able
to install a package called gnu-efi and be done with it. If not, you'll
need to download the source code tarball, build it, and install it. This
process is fairly typical of Linux packages. Read the GNU-EFI documentation
if you need help. If you're using GNU-EFI, you can skip the rest of this
section.

You might want to use the TianoCore toolkit if you have problems with
GNU-EFI or if you want to build rEFInd on a non-Linux platform.
Unfortunately, the TianoCore toolkit is weird by Linux programming
standards. It's also quite large -- it's intended as a means to develop a
complete EFI firmware implementation, so it contains much more code than is
needed to develop standalone EFI applications. I don't know of any Linux
distribution packages for it in RPM, Debian package file, or other formats;
you MUST install the kit from source code using its own unusual compilation
procedure. The installation documentation also omits at least one step and
is a bit unclear about others. Here's how I installed the toolkit:

1. Download UDK2014.SR1.UP1.P1 from
   https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/UDK2014-Releases.
   Note that UDK2015 is now available, but it will soon be rendered obsolte
   by UDK2017, which is due out in June of 2017. This document describes
   three distinct compilation methods for TianoCore, each of which has
   compatibility problems with some architectures. Specifically, the "make
   tiano" target fails with EDK2 for all architectures; and the "make edk2"
   and "build" procedures work with EDK2 for all architectures but require
   modifications of project files to work with AARCH64. If you think UDK2014
   is too old, you might as well use an EDK2 daily release version from
   https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.

2. Type "mkdir /usr/local/UDK2014". You can use another directory, but the
   rEFInd Makefile assumes this location. You'll need to edit the EDK2BASE
   variable in the top-level Makefile if you install somewhere else.

3. Type "cd /usr/local/UDK2014".

4. Unzip the downloaded file (UDK2014.SR1.UP1.P1.Complete.MyWorkSpace.zip)
   in the current directory (/usr/local/UDK2014). This creates a handful of
   files, including a tarball and a couple of .zip files. (If you use an
   EDK2 daily release, you can skip ahead to step 8; EDK2 drops the
   multi-layered zip-file/tarball approach. You'll need to drop the
   "MyWorkSpace" directory component, though -- or create it yourself and
   move all your files there.)

5. Type "unzip UDK2014.SR1.UP1.MyWorkSpace.zip". This extracts the
   platform-neutral portion of the development kit.

6. Type "cd MyWorkSpace".

7. Type "tar xvf ../BaseTools\(Unix\).tar". This extracts the
   Linux/Unix-specific portions of the toolkit.

8. Follow the build instructions at
   https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=Using_EDK_II_with_Native_GCC_4.4;
   however, a few changes are required, as detailed below....

9. Type "source edksetup.sh BaseTools". This sets up some environment
   variables, so subsequent steps (NOT including compiling rEFInd or its
   drivers) must be typed in the shell you use for this step.

10. Edit Conf/target.txt and change the following:
    - ACTIVE_PLATFORM = MdePkg/MdePkg.dsc
    - TARGET = RELEASE (DEBUG might work, but I've not tested it).
    - TARGET_ARCH = X64 (on x86-64; leave this as IA32 on x86 or change it
      to AARCH64 on ARM64). If you plan to build multiple architectures,
      you can set this to "IA32 X64" or some other combination.
    - TOOL_CHAIN_TAG = GCC49 (or other value depending on your GCC version;
      type "gcc -v" to learn your GCC version number). Note that support
      for the latest GCC version takes a while to make it into the
      TianoCore toolkit, so if you're using a very recent GCC, you may need
      to specify an earlier version and hope for the best or modify
      Conf/tools_def.txt, as described shortly.
    The TianoCore Makefiles read some of these variables from this file
    and use them when accessing directories, so be sure to type these
    entries in the case specified.

11. The documentation refers to editing Conf/tools_def.txt in addition to
    Conf/target.txt, but doesn't specify what to change in
    Conf/tools_def.txt. I haven't found it necessary to make any changes in
    Conf/tools_def.txt EXCEPT for two cases:

    * When using GCC 4.7 on a Fedora 17 system with the original UDK2014,
      GCC 4.7 was newer than the most recent GCC that TianoCore supported at
      that time. With that setup, I found it necessary to change the
      following line:
        *_GCC46_X64_ASM_FLAGS            = DEF(GCC46_ASM_FLAGS) -m64 -melf_x86_64
        to:
        *_GCC46_X64_ASM_FLAGS            = DEF(GCC46_ASM_FLAGS) -m64
      Although GCC 4.7 and Fedora 17 are both ancient, something similar may
      be necessary if you're using a very recent GCC or some other compiler.

    * When cross-compiling for ARM64 (AARCH64) on an x86-64 system,
      I needed to edit various entries to point to the cross-compiler
      rather than the usual compilers. For instance:
        *_GCC49_AARCH64_CC_PATH           = ENV(GCC49_AARCH64_PREFIX)gcc
        to:
        *_GCC49_AARCH64_CC_PATH          = /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
      Similar changes for other variables in the same block are necessary.

12. Type "make -C /usr/local/UDK2014/MyWorkSpace/BaseTools/Source/C".
    (This step is not documented on the EDK Web page.) Note that this
    requires the g++ compiler and UUID development libraries.
    
13. Type "build" to build the main set of EDK2 files. This process is
    likely to take a few minutes. This step requires Python 2; if you have
    Python 3 installed, you may need to adjust the default python for this
    build (for instance, by typing "eselect python set python2.7" in
    Gentoo).

If you installed in a location other than the one I've specified, you must
edit the EDK2BASE variable in the top-level Makefile in the rEFInd source
package. Once the toolkit is installed, you can build the filesystem
drivers or rEFInd, as described below.


Compiling rEFInd the Unix/Linux Way
===================================

With your development system set up, you can compile rEFInd as follows:

1. Download and uncompress the rEFInd source code archive. (If you're
   reading this file, you've probably already done this task.)

2. Open a Linux shell prompt

3. Change into the archive's main directory. You should see several files
   including this BUILDING.txt file and several subdirectories such as
   "refind", "libeg", "mok", "filesystems", and "include".

4. Type "make" to build rEFInd. The Makefile checks for the TianoCore
   toolkit and tries to use it if it's present. If both toolkits are
   installed, you can specify the toolkit name -- "make gnuefi" to build
   with GNU-EFI, or "make tiano" to build with TianoCore. (Typing "make
   edk2" will compile with TianoCore in a more roundabout way, as described
   later, in "Compiling rEFInd the Hybrid Way.") With any luck, rEFInd will
   compile without error, leaving the "refind_ia32.efi", "refind_x64.efi",
   or "refind_aa64.efi" file, depending on your platform, in the "refind"
   subdirectory. This same step builds the "gptsync_ia32.efi",
   "gptsync_x64.efi", or "gptsync_aa64.efi" program file, in the "gptsync"
   subdirectory. (When cross-compiling with TianoCore, "gptsync_aa64.efi" is
   not built because the cross-compiler failed for me. Since gptsync is
   likely to be useless on ARM64, this is no great loss.) If you want to
   build IA32 binaries on an x86-64 (X64) system, type "ARCH=ia32 make".
   Similarly, you can specify "ARCH=aarch64" to cross-compile for ARM64.
   This works only if you're using the TianoCore build kit, and only if you
   set TARGET_ARCH to the appropriate value in target.txt when you set up
   the TianoCore toolkit. If you plan to build multiple architectures, be
   sure to copy the .efi file for the first build out of the refind
   subdirectory and type "make clean" before building the second
   architecture.

5. The default build process does NOT build the filesystem drivers. If you
   want to build them, you must type "make fs" in the main rEFInd source
   directory. This command builds with the TianoCore toolkit if it's
   available and with GNU-EFI if it's not. Alternatively, you can type
   "make fs_gnuefi" to build with GNU-EFI or "make fs_tiano" to build with
   TianoCore. (You can prepend "ARCH=ia32" or "ARCH=aarch64" to
   cross-compile for those architectures, as when building the main rEFInd
   binary.) The result is filesystem drivers in the filesystems
   subdirectory, and also copies placed in the drivers_{arch} subdirectory.

If rEFInd doesn't compile correctly, you'll need to track down the source
of the problem. Double-check that you've got all the necessary development
tools installed, including GCC, make, and either GNU-EFI or TianoCore EDK2.
You may also need to adjust the Makefile or Make.common file; or possibly
Make* files in code subdirectories. (The main Makefile controls the process
for both toolkits, while Make.common holds most common options.) The most
likely thing you'll need to change is the path to the various GNU-EFI
include files and libraries. Since rEFInd 0.6.2, the default Make.common
file includes the following definitions:

EFIINC          = /usr/include/efi
GNUEFILIB       = /usr/lib
EFILIB          = /usr/lib
EFICRT0         = /usr/lib

If you've installed GNU-EFI from source code, you may need to add "local" to
those paths, as in "/usr/local/include/efi". You might need to change
references to "lib" to "lib32" or "lib64" on some systems. Recall that you
need at least GNU-EFI version 3.0l (that's a lowercase letter "L") to build
rEFInd, and some older or behind-the-times distributions might provide
out-of-date versions of this package.

If you're using TianoCore's EDK2, as noted earlier, you may need to adjust
the EDK2BASE variable in Makefile.


Compiling rEFInd the TianoCore Way
==================================

If you use TianoCore, you may know that the standard way to build
applications under that environment does not follow the typical Unix/Linux
development model described above. Instead, the application to be compiled
is dropped into the main TianoCore source tree and compiled there using the
"build" command. rEFInd can be compiled in this way, but I do not officially
support or encourage this method. Nonetheless, I am providing instructions
on doing it because it may work better than rEFInd's Makefiles in some
cases, especially if you're using a non-Linux platform for development. I've
successfully compiled rEFInd 0.10.8 under OS X in this way. (I present
details and caveats shortly.) The procedure is:

1. Download and prepare the TianoCore toolkit, as described earlier,
   under "Preparing Your Development Kit." Note that you will have to adjust
   this procedure if you're using a non-Linux OS.

2. Change to the directory that holds the BaseTools, MdePkg, ShellPkg, and
   other directories and files. If you use the UDK2014.SR1.UP1.P1 package
   noted earlier, this would be the MyWorkSpace directory.

3. Unpack the rEFInd source tarball in the current directory.

4. Rename the rEFInd directory (refind-{version}, where {version} is the
   version number) to RefindPkg. Alternatively, create a symbolic link
   called RefindPkg that points to the real directory.

5. Type "source edksetup.sh BaseTools". (You can skip this step if you're
   using the same login session you used to build the TianoCore toolkit; you
   need to type this command only if you've logged out and back in again,
   are using a different window from the one you used to build TianoCore, or
   have otherwise modified the environment variables set in edksetup.sh.)

6. If you're using UDK2014 AND you're compiling for AARCH64, you must
   open refind.inf, gptsync.inf, and the .inf files for all the drivers in
   the filesystems subdirectory and comment out the line that reads
   "CompilerIntrinsicsLib". This library is needed for later versions of
   EDK2 but is not present in (and not required for) UDK2014.

7. Type "build -p RefindPkg/RefindPkg.dsc" to build rEFInd. If you've
   properly configured your TianoCore installation for cross-compiling, you
   may add "-a {ARCH}", where {ARCH} is an architecture code, to compile for
   that platform. For instance, "build -a IA32 -p RefindPkg/RefindPkg.dsc"
   builds for IA32 (32-bit x86), even on another type of computer.

The rEFInd package should build, leaving binaries buried ridiculously deep
within the directory tree. For instance, on my test build, the rEFInd
binaries were at:

Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/BTRFS.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/EXT2.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/EXT4.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/GPTSYNC.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/HFS.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/ISO9660.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/NTFS.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/REFIND.efi
Build/Refind/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/REISERFS.efi

I've tested this procedure under Ubuntu 16.04 with GCC 5.4.0 and under OS X
10.11 with both Clang 7.0.0/XCode 7.1.1 and Clang 8.0.0/XCode 8.1.1. (See
below for Mac caveats.) In theory, it might work under Windows, but if you
use anything but a GCC- or Clang-derived compiler, there's a good chance
you'll run into a compiler-specific code incompatibility. This procedure is
not officially supported or recommended, since I'm testing and updating the
procedure only sporadically and it does not compile the iPXE module.

My build under OS X required several changes for compilation to succeed:

* A relatively recent TianoCore EDK2 from the TianoCore git repository
  is required; the stable UDK2014 and UDK2015 DO NOT work. Presumably
  UDK2017 will work once it's released.

* Setting up the Mac development environment required following instructions
  at https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Xcode, with the
  caveat that the UnixPkg directory described there is essentially empty;
  instead, I compiled the BaseTools/Source/C code, as described earlier. (I
  don't know if this was strictly necessary, but the tools did compile,
  despite several warnings.) I also skipped installing QEMU.

* Instead of "TOOL_CHAIN_TAG = GCC49", I set "TOOL_CHAIN_TAG = XCODE5" in
  Conf/target.txt.

* I had to edit Conf/tools_def.txt and edit the RELEASE_XCODE5_X64_CC_FLAGS
  line to remove the "-Werror" option. With this option set, the main rEFInd
  binary and several drivers failed to build.

* I had to edit refind.inf and uncomment the line in the Packages section
  that reads "StdLib/StdLib.dec".

* I've been unable to get the Btrfs driver to build. To adjust the package
  to omit this driver, edit the RefindPkg.dsc file and remove the line near
  the bottom that reads "RefindPkg/filesystems/btrfs.inf".

Note that if you want to use macOS or Windows to compile rEFInd, you might
be able to create a project or Makefile for your non-GCC compiler or use a
GCC port, such as MinGW (http://www.mingw.org), along with the procedure
described earlier, under "Compiling rEFInd the Unix/Linux Way." You'd
probably need to adjust the Makefiles in the latter case.


Compiling rEFInd the Hybrid Way
===============================

A final method of compiling rEFInd exists that layers a Unix/Linux-style
Makefile atop the TianoCore build tools. To use this method, proceed as
follows:

1. Unpack and build the TianoCore toolkit, as described earlier, in
   "Preparing Your Development Kit." Note that this directory tree must be
   readable to the user that will ultimately build rEFInd; and the
   Build and Conf subdirectories MUST BE WRITEABLE to this user.

2. Unpack the rEFInd source tarball (as you've presumably already done
   if you're reading this file). You can put it wherever you want.

3. Adjust the EDK2BASE variable near the top of the Makefile so that it
   points to the location of the TianoCore toolkit -- that is, the directory
   that holds the BaseTools, Conf, MdePkg, and various other subdirectories.

3. Change into the rEFInd source directory and type "make edk2". If
   you want to build for something other than the current machine's
   architecture, type "ARCH={ARCH} make edk2", where {ARCH} is the target
   architecture code, such as "ia32" or "aarch64".

4. If you want to compile the filesystem drivers, type "make fs_edk2".
   (You can add an architecture code, if you like).

The result should be a compiled set of binaries in the same locations as the
other methods produce -- refind/refind_{arch}.efi,
gptsync/gptsync_{arch}.efi, and drivers in the drivers_{arch} directory.
Binaries (with slightly different names) and intermediate files will also
appear buried in the Build/Refind subdirectory tree of the TianoCore
toolkit.

This method has several advantages and disadvantages compared to other
methods, and particularly to the standard Makefile with a target of "tiano."
The advantages of this method include:

* Because it uses the standard TianoCore build system, it's more likely to
  work with more versions of the TianoCore toolkit. (As of rEFInd 0.10.9, no
  TianoCore toolkit later than UDK2014 works with the "tiano" target, but
  the "edk2" target works with the latest EDK2 branch, as of May 2017.)
* This method is more likely to work with future versions of the
  TianoCore toolkit without major overhauls.
* The Makefile entries for this method are much simpler than are the
  "tiano" target's Makefile entries.

Drawbacks of this method include:

* It is, as of yet, poorly tested.
* It takes a bit longer to compile than the "tiano" target does.
* This method does not work for AARCH64 with UDK2014 without modifying the
  project's .inf files to remove references to CompilerIntrinsicsLib, as
  described earlier, under "Compiling rEFInd the TianoCore Way."


Installing rEFInd
=================

With rEFInd compiled, you can install it. The easiest way to do this is
with the refind-install script, which works on both Linux and macOS.
Alternatively, you can type "make install" to install using this script.
Note that this script copies files to the ESP and uses "efibootmgr" (on
Linux) or "bless" (on macOS) to add rEFInd to the firmware's boot loader
list. The docs/man/refind-install.8 file (and its HTML conversion,
docs/refind/refind-install.html) provides more details on this script and
its use.

If refind-install doesn't work for you or if you prefer to do the job
manually, you may. On a UEFI-based system, you'll want to copy files on the
ESP as follows:

* Create a directory for rEFInd, such as EFI/refind.
* Copy refind/refind_ia32.efi or refind_x64.efi to the ESP's EFI/refind
  directory.
* Copy refind.conf-sample to the EFI/refind directory as refind.conf.
* Copy the icons subdirectory, including all its files, to EFI/refind.

You'll then need to activate rEFInd in your EFI. This can be done with
tools such as "efibootmgr" under Linux or "bless" under OS X. See the
docs/refind/installing.html file for details.


Note to Distribution Maintainers
================================

The refind-install script, and therefore the "install" target in the
Makefile, installs the program directly to the ESP and it modifies the
*CURRENT COMPUTER's* NVRAM. Thus, you should *NOT* use this target as part
of the build process for your binary packages (RPMs, Debian packages, etc.).
(Gentoo could use it in an ebuild, though....) You COULD, however, install
the files to a directory somewhere (/usr/share/refind or whatever) and then
call refind-install as part of the binary package installation process.
Placing the files directly in /boot/efi/EFI/{distname}/refind and then
having a post-install script call efibootmgr could also work, but this
assumes that the ESP is mounted at /boot/efi. Also, Debian packages try to
create symbolic links when updating packages, which won't work on an ESP,
which should use FAT. For packaging examples, see the refind.spec file and
debian subdirectory of the rEFInd source tarball.


Compiling the EFI Filesystem Drivers
====================================

To build all the drivers, you can type "make fs", "make fs_tiano", or "make
fs_gnuefi" from the main directory, which builds the drivers and places
copies in both the filesystems and drivers_{arch} subdirectories.

To install drivers, you can type "make install" in the "filesystems"
directory. This copies all the drivers to the "/boot/efi/EFI/refind/drivers"
directory. Alternatively, you can copy the files you want manually. The
refind-install script includes an optional "--alldrivers" option that will
install all the drivers along with the main rEFInd program, but to the
drivers_{arch} subdirectory of the main rEFInd installation directory.

*CAUTION:* Install drivers for your system's architecture *ONLY*.
Installing drivers for the wrong architecture causes some systems to hang
at boot time. This risk can be minimized by including the architecture code
in the drivers subdirectory name (drivers_x64 or drivers_ia32).

The drivers all rely on filesystem wrapper code created by rEFIt's author,
Christoph Pfisterer. Most of the drivers seem to have passed through
Oracle's VirtualBox project (https://www.virtualbox.org) and the Clover
boot loader project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/),
which I used as the source for this build.


Adding Support for Network Boot
===============================

rEFInd provides EXPERIMENTAL support for booting over the network using
iPXE (http://ipxe.org) as a means to receive the payload. In order to
enable this feature you'll want to follow these instructions:

* cd net/
* make source
* make netboot
* copy bin/ipxe.efi and bin/ipxe_discover.efi to the EFI volume at EFI/tools/

Note that you may need to install additional development packages, such as
libiberty-dev and binutils-dev, in addition to those needed to build rEFInd
itself.

My own tests show this support to work under optimal conditions; however,
architecture (EFI vs. BIOS) detection may not work, and some computers will
hang or won't retrieve boot files from the network. For these reasons, this
support is disabled by default in rEFInd, and I do not provide iPXE
binaries.
